# Titanic-Survival-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-with-R

## Introduction:
Embark on a data-driven journey to uncover the mysteries of the Titanic disaster through exploratory data analysis. In this analysis, 
we leverage the power of R to dissect the dataset, revealing insights into the factors that influenced survival rates on that fateful night.

## Dataset Overview:
The dataset at our disposal contains a wealth of information about Titanic passengers, including their socio-economic status, age, gender, and 
embarkation point. Each row represents a passenger, and the dataset includes a binary variable indicating whether the passenger survived or not.

## Objective:
Our mission is to explore patterns, correlations, and trends within the data, aiming to answer questions such as: What demographics had a higher 
chance of survival? Did socio-economic factors play a crucial role? Were there any notable disparities in survival rates based on gender or age?

## EDA Steps:

### 1. Data Cleaning:
-Handle missing values.
-Identify and address outliers.

### 2. Descriptive Statistics:
-Calculate and visualize summary statistics.
-Explore the distribution of key variables.

### 3. Survival Analysis:
-Examine the overall survival rate.
-Investigate survival rates across different passenger classes.

### 4. Demographic Factors:
-Analyze survival patterns based on gender.
-Explore the impact of age on survival.


### 5. Socio-Economic Analysis:
-Investigate the relationship between socio-economic status and survival.
-Visualize survival rates based on fare paid and class.

### 6. Family Connections:
Explore the influence of family size on survival.

### 7. Visualizations:
-Create compelling visualizations, such as bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps, to illustrate findings.

## Conclusion:
Through this Titanic Survival EDA with R, we aim to paint a comprehensive picture of the events surrounding the sinking of the Titanic. By the end 
of our analysis, we hope to have unearthed intriguing insights into the factors that determined who would make it out alive from the icy depths of the 
Atlantic Ocean.
