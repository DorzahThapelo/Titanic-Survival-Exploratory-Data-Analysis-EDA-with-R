# Titanic Survival Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with R

Welcome to the Titanic Survival EDA project, where we embark on a data exploration journey using the R programming language to uncover insights from the famous Titanic dataset. This repository is your go-to resource for understanding the factors that influenced survival rates among Titanic passengers.

## Overview
The sinking of the Titanic remains a captivating historical event, and this project delves into the dataset with a focus on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is a crucial step in understanding the underlying patterns, relationships, and trends within the data.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Dive into the process of cleaning and preprocessing the dataset to ensure accurate and meaningful analysis.
- **Visualization:** Utilize R's powerful visualization libraries to create insightful charts and graphs that bring the data to life.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Apply statistical methods to extract valuable information and draw meaningful conclusions from the dataset.
- **Survival Predictors:** Explore the various factors that may have contributed to survival, such as passenger class, age, gender, and more.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository:**
